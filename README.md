## Features

### Local Saves
- FSL downloads your online save when no local save is found.  
- All subsequent save/load actions are redirected to your local hard drive.  
- Save files are stored in: `%APPDATA%\FSL`  
- Backups are automatically created, but manual backups are recommended.  
- Your online save is restored when FSL is disabled.

### Money Cheats
- Enter cheat codes using the tilde `~` key in online sessions:  
  - `1M` → Adds $1,000,000  
  - `10M` → Adds $10,000,000  
  - `100M` → Adds $100,000,000  
  - `1B` → Adds $1,000,000,000  
  - `10B` → Adds $10,000,000,000  

### Settings
- FSL generates a config file at `%APPDATA%\FSL` on first load.  
- Configuration changes require a game restart to apply.  
- Certain features depend on others (e.g., GTA+ or money cheats require local saves enabled).

## FAQ

**Is this safe?**  
Yes — your saves never touch Rockstar’s servers while FSL is active. Use a menu with an anti-cheat bypass for online sessions.

**Can I edit my saves?**  
Direct editing isn’t supported, but you can use CodeWalker to view them.

**What happens if I remove FSL?**  
Money added via FSL disappears because the tool stores your modified save locally. Re-enable FSL to restore your modded save.

**Can I bypass bans with FSL?**  
No. Previous bypass functionality is no longer available. You may still play in solo sessions if banned, but this isn’t guaranteed.

**Can I share my save files?**  
Yes, local save files can be shared with others.

**How do I know if FSL is loaded?**  
Check the online version in the Legal screen — it should display `(with FSL)`. If not, FSL may be outdated or not loaded correctly.
